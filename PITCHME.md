## THE PROBLEM


- Difficulty in  tracking learning progress

+++

- Ineffective communication with tutors and co-participants after class 



---
 

## THE SOLUTION


+++

<span class="primary">Checkify</span> 

+++

- A task management application with an in-built forum. 

+++

- This helps a participant track his/her progress with tasks. 
- Take notes in real time.
- Ask Questions if they encounter any problems.
